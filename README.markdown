# algosim-test-harness
🧠 ROADMAP

⏳ Phase 1: MVP (~40%)
Core dispatcher, evaluator stub
Basic types: string, number, boolean
Logging and progress console output

🔁 Phase 2: Type Extension (~70%)
Add matrix/vector/color support
Diff visualization
Symbolic and single-line format testing
Failure class recognition

🔬 Phase 3: Fidelity Enhancements (~90%)
Inject chapter names and events
Full parity with Test() signatures
Plug-in expected type wrappers (like ASO, ASOInt, etc.)

🌐 Phase 4: Integration & UX (~100%)
Web UI overlay or JSON export support
Visual fail list view
Async mode for expression evaluation
Optionally embed in a scene for graphical test results

🌎 REAL-WORLD USES
🧮 Math education: run symbolic or numeric tests in browser.
📈 Simulation engines: verify reactivity and consistency of controls.
🔎 AI debugging: generate ground-truth validation for prompt responses.
🧪 Web test suites: replace unit assertions with expressive test blocks.
🧠 3D geometry verification: use Three.js scenes with evaluate() driving visuals.
